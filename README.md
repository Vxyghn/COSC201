# CLASS

A class in Java is a set of objects which shares common characteristics/ behavior and common properties/ attributes.
It is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
      
# ARROW FUNCTION
Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax for writing function expressions. They also capture the this value from the surrounding context, making them particularly useful in certain scenarios like callbacks.
      
# VARIABLE
Variables are the data containers that save the data values during Java program execution. Every Variable in Java is assigned a data type that 
designates the type and quantity of value it can hold. A variable is a memory location name for the data.

# ARRAY METHODS
Arrays are fundamental structures in Java that allow us to store multiple values of the same type in a single 
variable.array methods are built-in functions that allow efficient manipulation and traversal of arrays. They provide essential functionalities like adding, removing, and transforming elements, as well as searching, sorting and iterating through array elements, enhancing code readability and productivity.

# DESTRUCTURING
Destructuring in JavaScript can be defined as a convenient way to extract values from arrays or properties from objects and assign them to variables. It makes code cleaner and more readable by reducing the need for repetitive assignments.
      
# MODULE
 A module is a self-contained piece of code that encapsulates functionality and can be reused across different parts of an application. Modules help organize code by separating concerns, improving maintainability, and facilitating code reuse.

 # TENARY OPERATORS
 The ternary operator is a concise way to perform conditional evaluations in JavaScript. It is also known as the conditional operator and is the only operator in JavaScript that takes three operands.
